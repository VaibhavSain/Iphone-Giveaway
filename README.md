This project is a simple iPhone Giveaway Alert web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app features a clean and interactive interface where users can click a button to enter the giveaway. Upon clicking, a stylish alert box appears, notifying them that they have successfully entered the giveaway. The design includes a modern layout with a responsive button and an elegant pop-up effect.

The functionality is powered by JavaScript, which dynamically reveals the alert box when the user interacts with the button. The CSS styling ensures a visually appealing design, including smooth transitions and a well-structured alert box.

This project is great for beginners learning front-end development and can be expanded with additional features like a countdown timer, random winner selection, or integration with a backend system for real giveaways. ðŸš€
